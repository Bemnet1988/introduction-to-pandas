# pandas

Materials for teaching the introductory pandas workshop at UC Berkeley's D-Lab.

## Set Up

For this workshop we'll be using a Jupyter notebook. An IPython notebook will be provided for attendees who are not yet on IPython 3.0.0 or above.

The best learning experience happens when you can edit and run code. So, please have pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter or IPython (and the notebooks) installed.

```
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/juanshishido/introduction-to-pandas.git

# navigate to the repo
$ cd introduction-to-pandas

# start the interaction session
$ jupyter notebook

# alternatively
$ ipython notebook
```

## Outline

For this workshop, we'll go through an example using European unemployment data. We'll load, view, and modify the data as well as calculate some descriptive statistics. The idea is to get a sense of what it would be like to use pandas as part of your workflow.

We plan to cover:

* pandas data structures
* loading data
* subsetting and filtering
* calculating summary statistics
* dealing with missing values
* merging data sets
* creating new variables
* basic plotting
* exporting data
